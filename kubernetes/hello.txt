Your Kubernetes control-plane has initialized successfully!

To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user:

  mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
  sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
  sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

Alternatively, if you are the root user, you can run:

  export KUBECONFIG=/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf

You should now deploy a pod network to the cluster.
Run "kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml" with one of the options listed at:
  https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/

You can now join any number of the control-plane node running the following command on each as root:

  kubeadm join 192.168.1.72:6443 --token 14pmvp.le2yg84ow8sndykv \
    --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:3edd2b58e7d3b4d1b7e40fe25185594f1f80ddc5c0be8007c4d6682a4cfdb668 \
    --control-plane --certificate-key 0c93e56c53fcbac5b86f0e3b76bd230a59bb3125e3589ee0d546d6eb607878b7

Please note that the certificate-key gives access to cluster sensitive data, keep it secret!
As a safeguard, uploaded-certs will be deleted in two hours; If necessary, you can use
"kubeadm init phase upload-certs --upload-certs" to reload certs afterward.

Then you can join any number of worker nodes by running the following on each as root:

kubeadm join 192.168.1.72:6443 --token 14pmvp.le2yg84ow8sndykv \
    --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:3edd2b58e7d3b4d1b7e40fe25185594f1f80ddc5c0be8007c4d6682a4cfdb668
